    PDF[/url]\n\nReceived prompt:\n\"When I was thinking about what I'd want I found
    something that feels like it's a rather uncommon element in a module: Life. My
    prompt is to make a module with something of a lifeform on it. This can be any
    number of organisms and species. Be it an animal, plant, fungus, prokaryotic or
    even fictional it's fine by me. I just think it'd be cool to have some more life
    on a bomb that's normally just bits of metal and other inorganic things. There
    are probably plenty of ways to explore this concept, so please try to make something
    original and maybe not something like a generic table lookup (unless you can make
    that interesting I suppose). Also preferably don't make a tamagotchi. That kind
    of feels like a low hanging fruit and I'm curious what can sprout from the available
    creativity.\""
